# Learn Penetration Testing with Python 3.x

Perform Offensive Pentesting and Prepare Red Teaming to Prevent Network Attacks and Web Vulnerabilities

This is the repository for [Learn Penetration Testing with Python 3.x](https://in.bpbonline.com/products/learn-penetration-testing-with-python-3-x?_pos=1&_sid=efdf83eec&_ss=r), published by BPB Publications.

## About the Book
This book starts with an understanding of penetration testing and red teaming methodologies and teaches Python 3.x from scratch for those who are not familiar with programming. The book gives the skills of how to create scripts for cracking, and brute force attacks.
 
The second part of this book focuses on the network and wireless level. The book teaches you the skills of how to create an offensive tool using Python 3.x to identify different services and ports using different Python network modules and conducting network attacks. In the network monitoring section, you will be able to monitor layers 3 and 4. And finally, you will be able to conduct different attacks on wireless.
 
The last part of this book focuses on web applications and exploitation developments. It focuses on how to create scripts to extract web information such as links, images, documents, etc. It also focuses on how to create scripts to identify and exploit web vulnerabilities and how to bypass WAF. The last chapter of this book focuses on exploitation development starting with how to play with the stack and then moving on to how to use Python in fuzzing and creating exploitation scripts.

## What you will learn
